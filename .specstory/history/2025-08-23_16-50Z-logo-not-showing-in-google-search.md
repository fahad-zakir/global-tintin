I'll help you troubleshoot why your logo isn't showing when your site appears in Google search results. Let me first examine your current HTML file to understand how the logo is currently implemented.

Now I can see your website's HTML structure. I notice that you have several meta tags for social media and SEO, but there are some issues with the logo implementation for Google search results. Let me analyze the current setup and identify what needs to be fixed.

## Todo List

- [-] Analyze current logo implementation and identify missing meta tags for Google search results
- [ ] Add Open Graph image meta tag for social media and search engines
- [ ] Add Twitter Card image meta tag
- [ ] Verify schema.org structured data has correct logo URL
- [ ] Add proper Apple touch icon meta tags with different sizes

I can see the issue! Your website is missing the crucial **Open Graph image** and **Twitter Card image** meta tags that Google uses to display logos in search results. While you have the favicon set up correctly and the logo is properly referenced in the schema.org structured data, search engines also look for specific social media meta tags to determine what image to show.

Let me fix this by adding the missing meta tags:
