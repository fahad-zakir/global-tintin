I can see you're having an issue with Google Search Console reporting "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" which is preventing your pages from being indexed. This is a common issue when hosting a site through GitHub Pages with a custom domain. Let me help you fix this.

First, let me examine your current HTML file to understand the structure and see what canonical tags are currently in place.

---

Read file: undefined

---

Now I can see the issue! Looking at your HTML file, I notice several problems that are causing the "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" error:

1. **Missing canonical link tag**: Your HTML doesn't have a canonical link tag
2. **Inconsistent domain references**: The Open Graph and schema markup references `globallgtinting.com` but your actual domain is `orlando-tinting.com`
3. **Multiple potential URL variations**: GitHub Pages can serve your site from multiple URLs, and without a canonical tag, Google sees duplicates

Let me create a todo list to fix these issues systematically:

---

## Todo List

- [-] Add canonical link tag pointing to orlando-tinting.com
- [ ] Update Open Graph URLs to use orlando-tinting.com instead of globallgtinting.com
- [ ] Update JSON-LD schema URLs to use orlando-tinting.com
- [ ] Verify CNAME file contents for proper domain configuration
- [ ] Ensure proper robots meta tag configuration

---

Let me start by checking your CNAME file to understand the current domain configuration:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Perfect! Your CNAME file is correctly configured. Now let me fix the HTML file to resolve the canonical and URL inconsistency issues:

## Todo List

- [x] Add canonical link tag pointing to orlando-tinting.com
- [x] Update Open Graph URLs to use orlando-tinting.com instead of globallgtinting.com
- [x] Update JSON-LD schema URLs to use orlando-tinting.com
- [x] Verify CNAME file contents for proper domain configuration
- [x] Ensure proper robots meta tag configuration

Now let me check for any linting errors:

That's just a minor CSS warning that won't affect functionality. Now, let me also add a robots.txt file to help with SEO and crawling:

Now let me commit these changes and push them to GitHub:

```bash
cd /Users/fahadzakir/Desktop/global_tinting && git add .
```

```
